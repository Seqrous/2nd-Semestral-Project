# 2nd-Semetral-Project
A product/order management system inspired by a Croatian company

### Overview:
On a 2nd semester we were faced with a problem of finding a company that would be willing to co-operate with our development group. The task was to perform a business analysis, examine company's structure and research with what kind of software both employees and employers would be satisfied with and implement a system. Our choice was a Croatian company called Ferometal-Prerada, producing parts for both rail and agriculture industries. After short, but fruitful investigation we have decided to create a software that could help them with storage/product and order management, with the aim of helping them save the money. In the end, after the group had fallen apart, only a small prototype has been delivered.

### Project consists of:
- code located in *src*,
